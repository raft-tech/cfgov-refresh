# cfgov-refresh

This is a fork of the [main cfgov-refresh](https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh) for [Raft's](https://goraft.tech/) work on the Digital Money Toolkit project. Some of the User Research, Design, and Technical artifacts can be found [in the Wiki](https://github.com/raft-tech/cfgov-refresh/wiki). The ReactJS codebase is integrated into Wagtail Django CMS as a satellite application.

The master repository for [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).
This Django project includes the front-end assets and build tools,
[Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for front-end rendering,
code to configure our CMS, [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/),
and several standalone Django apps for specific parts of the site.

## Backlog

The backlog for this project is being maintained in the CFPB Enterprise GitHub whereas the bugs are captured in this fork. 

## Pull request process

We follow the following steps for developing and creating end-of-sprint pull-request reviews:

1. Raft developers create PR's from their branches into `my-money-calendar`
2. The PR is reviewed and issues are resolved as new commits to the same branch
3. The PR is merged after the manual review and the tests via CircleCI pass
4. A new PR is open from `my-money-calendar` to `cfgov-refres/my-money-calendar`
5. The PR follows the [pull request template](https://github.com/raft-tech/cfgov-refresh/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
6. The PR is reviewed/merged and deployed to CFPB dev servers 
7. When functionality is ensured, a PR is opened from `cfgov-refres/my-money-calendar` to `cfgov-refres/master`


## Quickstart

Full installation and usage instructions are available in
[our documentation](https://cfpb.github.io/cfgov-refresh).

This project requires Python 3.6, Node 8, and Gulp 4.
We recommend the use of [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for keeping the project's Python dependencies contained.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cfpb/cfgov-refresh.git
```

Create a virtual environment for Python dependencies:

```sh
cd cfgov-refresh
mkvirtualenv --python=python3.6 cfgov-refresh
```

Create and load initial environment settings:

```sh
cp -a .env_SAMPLE .env
source .env
```

Install third-party dependencies and build frontend assets:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Create a local database, a Wagtail admin user, and a site homepage:

```sh
./initial-data.sh
```

Start your local Django server:

```sh
./runserver.sh
```

Your site will be available locally at <http://localhost:8000/>.

The Wagtail admin area will be available at <http://localhost:8000/admin/>,
which you can log into with the credentials `admin`/`admin`.
